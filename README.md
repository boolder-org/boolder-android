## Build the app

### Codebase overview

The app is written in Kotlin, and uses several libraries:
- Ktor 
- KotlinX.Serialization 
- Room 
- Mapbox SDK 
- Koin 
- Coil

Here is a 15-min video describing the architecture of the app : https://youtu.be/Qk7gX1CaMk4

### Mapbox setup

Create a file named `gradle.properties` in the `~/.gradle/` directory, with the following content:

```
MAPBOX_DOWNLOAD_TOKEN={TOKEN}
```

Replace `{TOKEN}` with mapbox secret key.
